# sWeather
## A simple CLI program for weather
### It uses OpenWeather's 'Current Weather Data' API (might add their '5 Day / 3 Hour Forecast' and 'Air Pollution' APIs in the future)
### There's also a possibility for a switch to Open-Meteo's API due to it being open-source and not needing an API key
### The installer downloads the program and the settings file from the GitHub repo and puts them in a folder created in the location specified by the user
### (Offline installer, not needing additional downloading during the installation might be added)
### The project is in a very early stage of development, for now development is directed towards the program being functional, and it getting easier to use
### Later the code, might get more optimized, and the API change might happen
